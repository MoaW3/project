It’s the fourth version of the game - the first being The Sims (usually referred to as “The Sims 1”, from the year 2000). The game mainly focuses on creating and controlling neighborhoods of virtual people, sims. The game can be divided into three separate parts; <a class="link" href="cas.html">Create-A-Sim</a>, <a class="link" href="bab.html">Build and Buy</a> and <a class="link" href="gameplay.html">Gameplay</a>.Throughout the years the game has been updated numerous times and a ton of different expansion packs have been developed. (Read more about this <a class="link" href="modsguide.html">ON THIS PAGE</a>.) This website offers some information about the game, as well as some useful cheats and mods. The content is primarily about the Sims 4 on PC, as mods unfortunately dont work on the console version. </p><h2>What are cheats and mods?</h2> <p> The game has a feature that allows the player to cheat, like giving their sims a lot of money (simoleons) instead of working. </p><p> Mods are (usually) free downloadable content that players themselves have made and published on the internet. Usually mods have to be updated and re-enabled every time the game updates. These can be a great alternative to buying expansion packs and other extra content - but be really careful about where you download things because the internet cant always be trusted. There are two types of mods; </p><p> Script mods: Changes something about how the game works, like adding different activities for sims or how they behave. </p><p> Custom Content: Clothes, furniture, accessories, makeup, decoration and so on that can be downloaded as mods. There are a few websites where these can be found, like The Sims Resource (this site does not allow adblock and will usually not let you download anything if you have it), but they can also be found on Tumblr and Patreon. </p></div><div class="row"> <div class="column"> <img src="images/simscasimage.webp" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(1)" onkeypress="openModal();currentSlide(1)" class="hover-shadow" height="190" alt="Create-A-Sim"> </div><div class="column"> <img src="images/simsgameplayimage.webp" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(2)" onkeypress="openModal();currentSlide(2)" class="hover-shadow" height="190" alt="Gameplay"> </div><div class="column"> <img src="images/simsbuildimage.webp" onclick="openModal();currentSlide(3)" onkeypress="openModal();currentSlide(3)" class="hover-shadow" height="190" alt="Build & Buy"> </div></div><div id="myModal" class="modal"> <article class="close cursor" onclick="closeModal()" onkeypress="closeModal()">&times;</article> <div class="modal-content"> <div class="mySlides"> <div class="numbertext">1 / 3</div><img src="images/simscasimage.webp" style="width:100%" alt="create-a-sim"> </div><div class="mySlides"> <div class="numbertext">2 / 3</div><img src="images/simsgameplayimage.webp" style="width:100%" alt="create-a-sim"> </div><div class="mySlides"> <div class="numbertext">3 / 3</div><img src="images/simsbuildimage.webp" style="width:100%" alt="create-a-sim"> </div><a href="#" class="prev" onclick="plusSlides(-1)" onkeypress="plusSlides(-1)">&#10094;</a> <a href="#" class="next" onclick="plusSlides(1)" onkeypress="plusSlides(1)">&#10095;</a> <div class="caption-container"> <p id="caption"></p></div><div class="column"> <img class="demo" src="images/simscasimage.webp" onclick="currentSlide(1)" onkeypress="currentSlide(1)" alt="Nature"> </div><div class="column"> <img class="demo" src="images/simsgameplayimage.webp" onclick="currentSlide(2)" onkeypress="currentSlide(2)" alt="Snow"> </div><div class="column"> <img class="demo" src="images/simsbuildimage.webp" onclick="currentSlide(3)" onkeypress="currentSlide(3)" alt="Mountains"> </div></div></div></header> </body></html>
