    <p>There are 4 different types of content packs in the sims 4. Expansion packs, game packs, stuff packs and kits. Expansion packs contain the most content out of the four and focus on new game features as well as clothes, furniture, neighborhoods, worlds and life states. Game packs are similar to expansion packs, but are smaller and with less content. Stuff packs usually only include clothes and furniture - and only occasionally gameplay features. Kits are the smallest type of content packs and only come with a few objects and gameplay changes and were first released in 2021.</p>
